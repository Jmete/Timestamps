# Timestamps

Timestamps is an small app written in python to easily time and track timestamps.

Download the compiled program at: www.jamesmete.com/projects/timestamps

I created this app due to my involvement in the streaming scene. Streamers often have to keep track of very long stream sessions for highlight moments. Timestamps allows you to easily start the timer, and press a button to log timestamps to a text file so that after your stream is done you can look back and easily see all your highlight moments.

This app allows streamers to increase their productivity and create better content for their fans easily. It especially helps video editors who often have to compile these highlights into youtube montages at a later time.

The app runs as a continuous timer in the background which allows a user to keep track of timestamps even when in the middle of a game. This functionality is quite difficult to achieve because it requires the app to log input even when not in focus. However, that functionality was needed to create the best experience for the user.

# How It Works

Using Timestamper is easy!

1) Open Timestamper

2) When you are ready to begin your activity, make sure to press 'ENTER' key with Timestamper window in focus to begin tracking the time.

Example: Start your stream, then quickly go to the Timestamper window and press the             'ENTER' key. Timestamper is now working.

3) Press the \ key at any time to log a timestamp.

Note: The Timestamper window does NOT need to be in focus for this to work. Simply press the \ key at any time when Timestamper is working (keeping track of time) and it will log the timestamp. Go ahead and keep focus on your game, Timestamper will work in the background!

4) When you are done your session. Press the ESCAPE key to stop Timestamper.

5) Your log file of all your timestamps will be in the Timestamps folder. The files are named according to the date and time that you started the session.

Note: Filenames are named according to 'MONTH-DATE-YEAR --- HOUR-MINUTE'

Only works on Windows due to dependencies.
